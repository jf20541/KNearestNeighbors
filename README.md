## Objective
Optimize two hyperparameters (K-values and Distance Function) for K-Nearest Neighbor Model.

Distance Function: [Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, Hamming]\
K-Value: output has 3 classifications, recommend an even K-Value

## Model
K-Nearest Neighbors: A non-parametric classification model that calculates the distance of n-test observations from all the observations of the training dataset and output as the class with the highest frequency from the K-most similar instances.

KK Disciplines\
Lazy Learning: Training is not required and all of the work happens at the time a prediction is requested.\
Instance-Based Learning: Raw training instances are used to make predictions.\
Non-Parametric: KNN makes no assumptions about the functional form of the problems being solved.

Avoid\
Curse of Dimensionality: As the number of dimensions increases the volume of the input space increases at an exponential rate
